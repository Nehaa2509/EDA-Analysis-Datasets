# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Datasets Used
1. Iris Dataset
2. Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset

## Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on multiple datasets to understand data distribution, patterns, outliers, and feature relationships before applying machine learning models.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Analysis Performed

### Iris Dataset
- Analyzed distribution of numerical features using histograms
- Identified outliers using box plots
- Studied feature relationships using correlation heatmaps
- Identified important features for species prediction

### Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset
- Analyzed content distribution using histograms and count plots
- Studied categorical features such as type and rating
- Identified outliers in release year
- Performed correlation analysis on numerical features

## Key Insights
- Iris dataset shows strong correlation between petal features and species
- Netflix dataset is categorical-heavy with limited numerical correlations
- Movies dominate the Netflix catalog
- Recent years show significant growth in Netflix content

## Repository Structure
- Iris_EDA.ipynb – EDA notebook for Iris dataset
- Netflix_EDA.ipynb – EDA notebook for Netflix dataset
- data/ – Contains all datasets used in this project

## Outcome
This project demonstrates practical understanding of EDA techniques and data behavior across different types of datasets.
